This repository is a heavily modified [grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) 1.1 adapted to be used as motor and GPIO controller for Four Thieves Winegar Collective Microlab.

Microlab uses stepper motors to control pumps and various pins on Arduino CNC Board as GPIO to control relays. 

DO NOT USE THIS REPOSITORY TO CONTROL YOUR CNC MACHINE - YOUR MACHINE WILL MOST LIKELY GET DAMAGED!!
